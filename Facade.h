/*
    The Facade Pattern is a design pattern in software engineering
    that falls under the structural pattern category. It provides a simplified and
    unified interface to a set of interfaces or subsystems within a larger system,
    making it easier to use and reducing the complexity of the system for clients.
    Essentially, it acts as a facade or entry point to a more complex system,
    shielding clients from its intricacies.

    Imagine you have a complex software system with numerous components,
    each having its own set of methods and interactions. Without the Facade Pattern,
    clients would need to interact with these components directly,
    which could lead to a tangled mess of dependencies and
    make the system difficult to understand and maintain.
